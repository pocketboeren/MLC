# MLC
 
Hi! Welcome on my first Git repo, dedicated to the Machine Learning Challenge organized at:
https://radu-enuca.gitbook.io/ml-challenge/

In this repo I keep track of the progress that I make during the course. Even though the course covers a lot of material, it also inspires me to explore other possibilities with python and other third party applications. 

This repo will also host the code of the <b>final project</b> of the course.

# What I learned so far
- How to use Git
    - Using the CMD and using a GUI (like GitHub Desktop)
    - Using a remote repo (on GitHub for example) and collaborate with other coders
    - How to use .gitignore
- Coding in python
    - Using the CMD
    - Using a IDE (after some testing, PyCharm is my IDE of choice)
    - How to use pip to install different packages
    - Creating a virtual environment for the project for maintaining the project dependencies (packages and versions)
    - Creating requirements.txt which can be used to install all project dependencies
    - Familiarize myself with the following packages:
        - numpy
        - matplotlib
        - pandas
        - scikit-learn
